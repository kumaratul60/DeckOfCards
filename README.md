# DeckOfCards
Designing a deck of cards using OOPs, where we can pull one card randomly.

OOPS -> If you ask me to explain OOP concepts in one line:

Hiding Data —> Encapsulation

Hiding Complexity —> Abstraction

Reuse Existing Functionality —> Inheritance

Same Signature Different Actions —> Polymorphism


import java.util.*; package

Use Enum class:
some Imp point regarding enum class-->

1. The Enum in Java is a data type which contains a fixed set of constants( group of constants).
2. Enums are used to create our own data type like classes. The enum data type (also known as Enumerated Data Type) is used to define an enum in Java
3. Java Enum internally inherits the Enum class, so it cannot inherit any other class, but it can implement many interfaces. We can have fields, constructors, methods, and main methods in Java enum.
4. Enum improves type safety
5. Enum can be easily used in switch
6. Enum can be traversed
7. Enum can have fields, constructors and methods
8. Enum may implement many interfaces but cannot extend any class because it internally extends Enum class
